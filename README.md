# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

NOTES/fuck ups:
I disabled line 2 in node_modules > is-bigint > tsconfig because a red dot popped up and VSCode said it was an error. Idk why it was, nor what it meant, but the red was annoying me so I turned it off. I'm a new developer and learning through a beginning program.
